Warning detected by hpeesofsim during DC analysis `Tran1'.
    Circuit converged after a virtual resistance of 1 TOhms 
    was added between each node and ground, and a virtual 
    resistance of 1 pOhms was inserted in each current branch. 
    Possible causes include floating nodes or missing ground.
