How to use the CD4000 devices.


My recommendation is very simple.


1.
Copy the symbol files you need into the folder where you have
saved your schematic.


2.
Copy CD4000.lib into this folder too.


3.
Include the model file in your schematic with a SPICE-directive.

.inc CD4000.lib


Alternatively there is now another library CD4000_v.lib available with 
inputs and outputs
 following the real supply voltage.

.inc CD4000_v.lib


4.
Right-mouse-click to the placed symbols and set VDD=xx to the
value of your supply voltage
